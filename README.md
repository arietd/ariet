#### Data Analysis Notebooks

I am an aspiring Data Scientist. I graduated from Monash University with a Bachelors in Business Infromation Systems. I have a huge interest in forecasting and studed Data Science for a year as part of Master of Data Science also Monash.

I work mostly in R and Python but do have an interest in branching out to Scala. Other than that I like to use Tableau for visualisations and dashboards. 

If you want to collaborate or just send me some feedback feel free to drop me an email. Your messages and advice is the data I need to improve my model/strategy in working in Analytics.
