#### About Me

I am passionate about using data to gain insights into how the world works. I enjoy writing and explaining concept through use of analogies and methaphors. I studied It and later Data Science at Monash. 



I work mostly in R and Python but do have an interest in branching out to Scala. Other than that I like to use Tableau for visualisations and dashboards. 

If you want to collaborate or just send me some feedback feel free to drop me an email. Your messages and advice is the data I need to improve my model/strategy in working in Analytics.
